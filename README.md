# Butters: A Django Web Application

In this project, I use Django to build a web application that uses Python to scrape comments off of YouTube videos and uses NLP to filter out any negative comments. I’m a South Park fan, so I justly called it Butters’ Safe Space and gave it a thematic flavor where Butters gets more and more depressed with the greater number of negative comments he must filter.
